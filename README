The goal of this mini project is to deploy a web service running a machine learning model with docker.

In case you need to work on the basics of docker, go make the docker sessions on nowledgeable.

If you are not confortable with web developpement you can do the session web backend basics

Level 0  (on your local machine)

Make sure you have a FastAPI backend that have a /predict endpoint which let use the  house price predictions from the previous model.

Test the model with your favorite http client (postman, hugo, requests python library, etc.)

Level 1 (on your local machine)

You want now to run the backend inside a docker container.
For that create a Dockerfile to create your custom Docker image

First run the container with raw docker cli commands.

Then create a docker-compose file

Level 2  -  Deploy the container in a cloud virtual machine

We have setup a Virtual machine for you.

    create a folder with your initial in the /home/ubuntu folder
    create a folder with

Level 3 - automatically build and deploy the container using a CD pipeline using gitlab or github action

Using pipelines, make sure that when you push an update of your backend in your favirote git server, a pipeline is triggered and the model is update in production.

Level 4 - adapt the process to a more interesting model

Adapt the previous work to deploy in production a more interesting model :

    it can be any model you trained in another course (image classification, cell segmentation, etc.)
    A T5  or a Bert model from hugging face
